## Our Endeavour

To develop, maintain, and distribute an easy to use, flexible, Linux & BTRFS based DIY software appliance solution.

**Open source and community focused.** We develop on GitHub in collaboration with our users,

our community, and anyone who wants to help.

**Docker based Rock-on Extensibility.** Easy to roll your own and then contribute it back to the community.

**Simplicity & Usability.** Simple clear and intuitive user interface for what most folks do, most of the time.

**DIY Personal storage.** Provides 'private cloud' storage to all your networked devices.

Privacy, security, and freedom.

**Simple Storage done Sustainably.**
