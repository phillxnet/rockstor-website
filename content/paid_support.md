## Incident-based Support subscription

An **'Incident-based Support subscription'** is a ***"Support included"*** variant of our **'Stable Updates subscription'**.

Primarily intended for installs´ running our [Stable Channel](https://rockstor.com/docs/update-channels/update_channels.html#stable-channel) releases 'Built on' non EOL openSUSE Leap.

Release Candidate (RC) [Testing Channel](https://rockstor.com/docs/update-channels/update_channels.html#testing-channel) installs may also be considered.

Our [downloadable]({{< relref dls.md >}}) installers use Stable or RC status 'rockstor' packages.

A complement to your existing IT resources. **We are here to help**

## Support FAQ

Question | Answer
--- | ---
**Incident definition?** | An incident is a question relating to a specific, discrete issue, and may involve several interactions with the support service to achieve resolution.
**Incident waiver?** | If your issue uncovers, or confirms, a 'rockstor' package bug, your Support Incident is considered unused. In this case we will be prioritising the related bugfix.
**Refund policy?** | The latest payment of either an 'Incident-based Support subscription' or a 'Stable Updates subscription', can be refunded for the EU mandated 14 day cooling-off period.
**I already have a Stable Updates subscription?** | [Support Email](mailto:support@rockstor.com) can transfer an existing 'Stable Updates subscription' Computer/activation-code, to a purchased 'Incident-based Support subscription'. You can then cancel your "Stable Updates subscription" via Open Collective.
**Can I revert to a 'Stable Updates subscription?** | Yes, the procedure is the reverse of the last answer.
**What if I need additional support incidents?** | Each 'Incident-based Support subscription' covers one incident & 1 year's Stable Updates subscription. You can ignore automated Appliance ID request emails if you only need the support incident.
